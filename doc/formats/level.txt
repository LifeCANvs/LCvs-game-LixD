Lix level file format
=====================

Levels are text files.

Tile groups are a composition of multiple tiles which can be used like one Single Terrain tile. 
They have following format:

The tile groups are defined within a bracket which marks the begin and the end of tile group and in between lines with the tile data of which the tile group is composed:

$BEGIN_TILE_GROUP <name of the group>
:<tile>: <position> [modifiers]
...
$END_TILE_GROUP

e.g.:

$BEGIN_TILE_GROUP 0
:simon/oriental/bridge1: 0 22
:simon/oriental/bridge1: 44 0
:simon/oriental/bridge1: 0 65 rr
:simon/oriental/bridge1: 44 43 rr
$END_TILE_GROUP

To call the tile group into existence, it is instantiated in the following form:

:Group-<name of the group>: <position> [modifiers]

e.g.:

:Group-0: 112 132 rr

That puts the tile group at the named position in the level like a Single Terrain tile.

Single Terrain tiles may have these modifiers:

d
    Tile has the option: Dark: Selected terrain erases normal terrain.

f
    Tile is mirrored vertically. Mirroring happens before any rotation ("r").
    The "f" stands for "flip".

frr
    Tile has the option: Flip: Mirrors the selected terrain horizontally.
    This is because "frr" is really a vertical rotation followed by two quarter
    turns, which is the same as horizontal mirroring.

n
    No-overwrite: Outdated tile option that has been substituted by tile
    groups. The meaning was: Paint only those pixels that, at the time of
    drawing, would go into empty space.

    The Lix editor will interpret parts of a file containing the "n" modifier
    as tile groups for backwards compatibility. With very bad luck, the
    generated tile group will span nearly the whole level and will be hard to
    edit, but it will at least look identical to the old meaning of "n".

r
    Tile has the option: Rotate: Performs a quarter turn on the selected
    terrain. This always means a clockwise quarter turn. Rotation will always
    happen after any vertical mirroring ("f"), not before. Multiple "r"
    indicate the number of rotations, up to 3.
