Custom trigger areas for Lix gadgets
====================================

Gadgets is a collective name for hatches, exits, traps, flingers, ...,
everything that you can place in a level other than earth and steel.
Lix guesses a trigger area for each gadget.

You can override Lix's guess for `images/path/mygadget.T.png' by creating
`images/path/mygadget.T.txt': A text file in the same folder, with the same
name, merely the image extension swapped for `.txt'.

Mix and match these directives in the text file:

#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_ABSOLUTE_X 20
#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_ABSOLUTE_Y 10
#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_X -5
#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_Y -12
#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_BOTTOM_Y 0
#TRIGGER_AREA_SIZE_X 20
#TRIGGER_AREA_SIZE_Y 20

#HATCH_OPENING_FRAME 1

#FLING_SPEED_X 4
#FLING_SPEED_Y -16
#FLING_NONPERMANENT
#FLING_IGNORE_X_ORIENTATION



Explanations
------------

#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_ABSOLUTE_X n

    The left edge of the trigger area will be n pixels away from the left edge
    of the gadget. If you want to center the trigger area horizontally, use
    #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_X instead.

#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_ABSOLUTE_Y n

    The upper edge of the trigger area will start n pixels away
    from the upper edge of the object. If you want to center the trigger area
    vertically or place it at the bottom of the object, use
    #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_Y or
    #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_BOTTOM_Y instead, see below.

#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_X n

    The center (not left edge) of the trigger area will be n pixels away from
    the horizontal center of the object. Use positive values to shift the
    trigger area to the right, and negative values to shift to the left.

#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_Y n

    The center (not upper edge) of the trigger area will be n pixels away from
    the vertical center of the object. Use positive values to shift the
    trigger area down, and negative values to pull it further up.

#TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_BOTTOM_Y n

    The center (not upper edge) of the trigger area will be n pixels away from
    the bottom of the object. Positive values will push it even further down,
    negative values pull it up. If you give 0 as the number, the center will
    be on the second-to-last pixel row vertically. This is the default setting
    for goals (exits).

#TRIGGER_AREA_SIZE_X n

    Set trigger area width to n pixels.

#TRIGGER_AREA_SIZE_Y n

    Set trigger area height to n pixels.

#HATCH_OPENING_FRAME n

    Specifies the animation frame that is to be displayed when the hatch
    opening sound is played. The default value is 1, i.e., there is no
    animation before the opening sound, only the constant frame 0. The frame
    count starts from zero. If this is set to a late frame, the hatch animates
    earlier after starting the level to match the sound. The setting has no
    effect on game physics.



Directives for flingers
-----------------------

Use the trap pre-extension .T for flingers, i.e., call your flingers like so:
myflinger.T.png

Flingers are gadgets that launch lix into the air by assigning them a
velocity. Trigger areas for these are defined like for any other gadget above.
By default, the object is permanent. Pass #FLING_NONPERMANENT for a triggered
flinger that processing one lix at a time. By default, lix will be flung
depending on their orientation. Pass #FLING_IGNORE_X_ORIENTATION to always
fling them into the same horizontal direction. If any of the parameters below
is encountered, the object will automatically be turned into a flinger.

#FLING_SPEED_X n

    Make the gadget a flinger. Horizontal speed will be n pixels forward
    in the direction of the lix.

#FLING_SPEED_Y n

    Make the gadget a flinger. Vertical speed will be n pixels.
    Give a negative value n to fling upwards, a positive value for downwards.

#FLING_NONPERMANENT

    Make the gadget a flinger that processes only one lix at a time.
    (By default, all lixes entering the trigger area would be flung at once.)

#FLING_IGNORE_X_ORIENTATION

    Make #FLING_SPEED_X ignore the lix's facing direction: Positive values
    to #FLING_SPEED_X will mean speed towards the right, negative values
    mean speed towards the left.
