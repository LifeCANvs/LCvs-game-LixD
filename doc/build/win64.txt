Install LDC and dub
-------------------

Download the D compiler LDC, version 1.13.0 or newer, for Windows-x64:

    https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases

7z files can be extracted with 7-Zip, available at:

    https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

Extract the LDC archive to a directory of your choice. We will refer
to that directory as the LDC directory.

Add LDC's bin/ subdirectory to your Windows PATH variable. How to do that
depends on your system:

* In Windows 7:
    1. Right-click My Computer.
    2. Select Properties in the pop-up menu.
    3. Go to the Advanced tab.
    4. Click Environment Variables.
    5. Highlight PATH and click Edit.
    6. Move the cursor to the end of PATH's value text.
    7. Add a semicolon ";" without quotes.
    8. Add the path to your LDC directory, followed by "\bin" without quotes.
    9. Click OK everywhere.

* In Windows 10:
    1. Open the Control Panel.
    2. Select System and Security.
    3. In the left column, select Advanced system settings.
    4. Go to the Advanced tab.
    5. Click Environment Variables.
    6. Highlight PATH and click Edit.
    7. Move the cursor to the end of PATH's value text.
    8. Add a semicolon ";" without quotes.
    8. Add the path to your LDC directory, followed by "\bin" without quotes.
    10. Click OK everywhere.

* In Wine on non-Windows systems:
    1. Run "wine regedit" from a shell.
    2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> System -> CurrentControlSet -> Control
        -> Environment.
    3. Edit the PATH variable.
    4. Append a semicolon ";" without quotes.
    5. Append the installation path of LDC, followed by "\bin" without quotes.
        Use backslashes instead of slashes, but I haven't tried slashes.
        C:\ will usually mean ~/.wine/drive_c/.
        Z:\ will usually mean the Linux sysem's root directory /.

Windows LDC already ships with a Windows version of dub, the D package manager.

To verify that both LDC and dub are installed properly:
    1. Open a command prompt.
    2. Run "dub" or "ldc2" without quotes.
    3. Check that both programs are found and output something different
        than "is not a recognized program or command".



Install Allegro 5 and enet
--------------------------

I have prepared all necessary DLLs in a single archive. Download this:

    http://www.lixgame.com/dow/lix-dlls-libs-win64.zip

Extract this into your LDC directory. You will get new DLLs in bin/ and
new LIBs in lib/. Proceed to the next section, "Get the Lix source".

If you don't trust me or prefer another way to get these files, you could
build Allegro 5 from source, or get the Allegro DLLs and LIBs from its NuGet
binary package. If you get them from the NuGet package, remove all files with
"debug" within their name. Copy the other DLLs to LDC's bin/ dir, the other
LIBs to LDC's lib/ dir. Match the filenames to what I provided in my archive.
above, for example bin/allegro_acodec-5.2.dll or lib/allegro_acodec.lib.
You'd also have to build enet from source.



Get the Lix source
------------------

* If you have git:
    Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/SimonN/LixD.git

* If you don't have git:
    Download the source as a zip archive here:

        https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/archive/master.zip

    Extract to a directory of your choice. We will refer to that directory
    as the Lix directory.


Compile Lix
-----------

Doubleclick win-build.bat in the Lix directory to build the game.
If successful, you will get an executable ./bin/lix.exe, run it to start Lix.
If Lix runs, proceed to the next section, "Add music".

Alternatively, if you prefer the command line instead of the batch file,
try either of these commands:

    dub build --compiler=ldc2
    dub build -b release --compiler=ldc2

The first command builds a debugging version that builds faster and produces
better error messages in case of a crash, but runs slower.

The second command is the same as the batch file win-build.bat. This builds
a release version that takes longer to build, but runs faster. Non-fatal
errors during play will be written to ./user/log.txt.



Add music
---------

Lix has music, but the music is not in version control. I encourage you to
add the music for a more complete experience. To get the music, download:

    http://www.lixgame.com/dow/lix-music.zip

Extract this into Lix's directory, you'll get a subdirectory ./music/.
