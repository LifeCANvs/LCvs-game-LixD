How to build Lix on a Linux machine
===================================

Lix is written in the D Programming Language and uses Allegro 5.

I'm describing the build process for Linux. It should be very similar for
Windows. I don't know where you install libraries, though.



Install a D compiler and dub
----------------------------

I recommend dmd as the D compiler, which ships with dub, the D packaging tool.
Get dmd from your package manager, or download it here:

    http://dlang.org/download.html

dub automates the build process, i.e., it replaces make, and it will fetch
the D bindings for installed and used libraries.



Install required libraries
--------------------------

Even though dub can download the libraries' D bindings from the dub website
and install them in ~/.dub for you, it cannot install the shared libraries
themselves to your system.

This part of the instructions is about installing binary files that can be
called from various programming languages. It's not particular to D.

If you use a package manager, install these libraries; they should come with

* Allegro 5
* enet

If you install manually, install the following libraries in the order listed,
because Allegro 5 relies on everything above it. You can get away without
dumb, but Lix won't play any tracked music then.

* zlib
* libpng
* libvorbis
* freetype
* dumb 2.0 or 0.9.3
* Allegro 5
* enet



Installing enet
---------------

Skip this section if you installed enet via your Linux package manager.

Right now, August 2016, I rely on enet 1.3.x. Download it from enet.bespin.org,
or clone from github:

    $ git clone https://github.com/lsalzman/enet

Lix uses enet via Derelict-enet. Derelict is a set of D library bindings and
wants dynamically linked libraries, not static libraries. Therefore, we will
build enet as a shared object:

    $ autoreconf -vfi
    $ ./configure --enable-shared=yes --enable-static=no
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If the game doesn't find the newly-built lib, run sudo /sbin/ldconfig.



Build Lix
---------

Open a shell, navigate to Lix's root directory, and run:

    dub

This builds a debug version and runs it immediately. To play the game
at a later time, invoke dub again, or run:

    ./bin/lix

If the debugging version compiles, links, and runs with no problems, you
might want to build a release version for better performance:

    dub build -b release-nobounds
