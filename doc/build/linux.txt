How to build Lix on a Linux machine
===================================

Install a D compiler and dub
----------------------------

Get dmd (a D compiler) and dub from your package manager, or download here:

    http://dlang.org/download.html
    https://code.dlang.org/download

dub automates the build and fetches D bindings for libraries.
dub does not install the libraries themselves, see next paragraph.



Install required libraries
--------------------------

Even though dub can download the libraries' D bindings from the dub website
and install them in ~/.dub for you, it cannot install the shared libraries
themselves to your system.

This part of the instructions is about installing binary files that can be
called from various programming languages. It's not particular to D.

If you use a package manager, install:

* pkg-config (Package `pkg-config' on Arch/Debian/Ubuntu)
* Allegro 5  (Package `allegro'    on Arch, `liballegro5-dev' on Debian/Ubuntu)
* enet       (Package `enet'       on Arch, `libenet-dev'     on Debian/Ubuntu)

If you install manually, install the following libraries in the order listed,
because Allegro 5 relies on everything above it. You can get away without
dumb, but Lix won't play any tracked music then.

* pkg-config
* zlib
* libpng
* libvorbis
* freetype
* dumb 2.0 or 0.9.3
* Allegro 5
* enet



Installing enet manually
------------------------

(Skip this section if you installed enet via your Linux package manager.)

Now (since August 2016), I rely on enet 1.3.x. Download it from
enet.bespin.org, or clone from github:

    $ git clone https://github.com/lsalzman/enet

Lix uses enet via Derelict-enet. Derelict is a set of D library bindings and
wants dynamically linked libraries, not static libraries. Therefore, we will
build enet as a shared object:

    $ autoreconf -vfi
    $ ./configure --enable-shared=yes --enable-static=no
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If the game doesn't find the newly-built lib, run sudo /sbin/ldconfig.



Build Lix
---------

Open a shell, navigate to Lix's root directory, and run:

    dub

This builds a debug version and runs it immediately. To play the game
at a later time, invoke dub again, or run:

    ./bin/lix

If the debugging version compiles, links, and runs with no problems, you
might want to build a release version for better performance:

    dub build -b release-nobounds



Add music
---------

Lix has music, but the music is not in version control. I encourage you to
add the music for a more complete experience. To get the music, download:

    http://www.lixgame.com/dow/lix-music.zip

Extract this into Lix's directory, you'll get a subdirectory `./music/'.
