How to add paths to your PATH
=============================

If you've downloaded LDC's installer, you don't need these instructions.

But if you've downloaded LDC's 7z archive, you must add the LDC executables'
path to your PATH variable, so that dub or manually typed commands can find
the LDC executables. Here is how to do that:

* In Windows 7:
    1. Right-click My Computer.
    2. Select Properties in the pop-up menu.
    3. Go to the Advanced tab.
    4. Click Environment Variables.
    5. Highlight PATH and click Edit.
    6. Move the cursor to the end of PATH's value text.
    7. Add a semicolon ";" without quotes.
    8. Add the path to your LDC directory, followed by "\bin" without quotes.
    9. Click OK everywhere.

* In Windows 10:
    1. Open the Control Panel.
    2. Select System and Security.
    3. In the left column, select Advanced system settings.
    4. Go to the Advanced tab.
    5. Click Environment Variables.
    6. Highlight PATH and click Edit.
    7. Move the cursor to the end of PATH's value text.
    8. Add a semicolon ";" without quotes.
    8. Add the path to your LDC directory, followed by "\bin" without quotes.
    10. Click OK everywhere.

* In Wine on non-Windows systems:
    1. Run "wine regedit" from a shell.
    2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> System -> CurrentControlSet -> Control
        -> Session Manager -> Environment.
    3. Edit the PATH variable.
    4. Append a semicolon ";" without quotes.
    5. Append the installation path of LDC, followed by "\bin" without quotes.
        Use backslashes instead of slashes, but I haven't tried slashes.
        C:\ will usually mean ~/.wine/drive_c/.
        Z:\ will usually mean the Linux sysem's root directory /.
