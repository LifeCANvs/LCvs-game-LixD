How to build Lix on a Windows machine
=====================================

This is hard. If you get stuck at any point, don't hesitate to contact me

Install D and dub
-----------------

Download dmd, the Digital Mars D compiler. It's possible to use compilers
other than dmd, for example gdc, but dmd is the one I've been using.
Get dmd here:

    http://dlang.org/download

During the installation, select the option to add the programs to PATH. You
want to call them from the command line later. You don't have to add anything
to the start menu. You don't need D1 support either.

If you would like, you may test the D environment. See appendix 1 at the
bottom of this file for how to write and compile a hello world program.

dmd already ships with dub, the D package manager.



Clone the Lix repo and test dub
-------------------------------

If you don't have git, download the source as a zip archive here, and unzip:

    https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/archive/master.zip

If you have git, you can instead clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/SimonN/LixD.git

Open a command line shell, navigate into the Lix root directory (where the
file dub.json sits) and run:

    dub

The package manager will download and set up D bindings for libraries I use.
It should finish the compilation, but error out during linking, because we
haven't installed the Allegro libraries. We will do that now.



Install Allegro 5
-----------------

Locate your D installation directory, and look for the windows/ subdir.
It might be in one of these paths:

    C:/D/dmd2/windows/
    C:/"Program Files"/D/dmd2/windows/

This also has subdirectories bin/ and lib/. If you like, make backups of these
directories, so you can retry if something goes wrong.

Download the Allegro DLLs and *.lib files from my website:

    http://www.lixgame.com/dow/alleg-5.2-dlls-libs.zip

Extract this into your D installation's windows/ directory.

Maybe you don't trust me instructing you to download opaque binaries? :-)
You can find or build Allegro 5.2 DLLs yourself, then follow the instructions
by SiegeLord on how to generate your .lib files from your own DLLs:

    https://github.com/SiegeLord/DAllegro5#windows-notes

Summary of that page: Find implib.exe, then, for each Allegro DLL xyz, call:

    implib /s allegro_xyz.lib allegro_xyz-5.2.dll

Put the resulting .lib files in the D installation's lib/ dir.
Remove the version number, e.g., `-5.2', from Allegro's .lib files in lib/.
Do not remove the version number from the DLL files, and keep those in bin/.

If it's not clear, ask me -- see top of file for contact details.

There's a German joke. What does "DLL" stand for? "Die lass liegen."
("Let this one lie around.")



Install enet
------------

I don't remember anything for this. Look at the enet section of
`./doc/build/linux.txt' and guess what you must do in Windows.

Most likely, you don't have to do anything now. Later, you should find an enet
DLL on the internet and put that in the path of the Lix binary. Otherwise,
the game will error out when you click "Networking mode" in the main menu.



Compile Lix
-----------

Enter the Lix directory, and run:

    dub

It should build the game, finding and linking against the Allegro 5 libraries
in the progress.

If the game finds all libraries, but crashes upon program startup, see
appendix 2.

If the game starts and runs without errors, compile a release build
for maximum performance:

    dub build -b release-nobounds

This takes longer to build. In case of a crash, you won't get a good
crash report either. Non-fatal errors go to ./data/log.txt.



Appendix 1
----------

To test whether the D compiler is set up, copy this into a file hello.d:

    import std.stdio;

    void main()
    {
        writeln("Hello World!");
    }

Open a command line shell, and run:

    dmd hello.d

It should generate an executable file, hello.exe, and an intermediate object
file, which you can safely delete.
