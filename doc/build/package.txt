Notes for package maintainers
=============================

Hi!

For binary packages in Linux distributions, I recommend to build Lix with this
dub command line:

    dub build -b releaseXDG

Explanation:

*   `dub' is the D build tool and D source package manager.

*   `build' is the dub command to build, but not execute.

*   `-b releaseXDG' builds with optimizations and inlining, without contracts
    or unittests, but still with array bounds checks.

    `-b releaseXDG' passes a version flag to the compiler to make Lix read
    from `/usr/local/share/lix' or, if that directory doesn't exist, from
    `/usr/share/lix', and to write to `${HOME}/.local/share/lix'. These paths
    can be configured at runtime with environment variables by the XDG Base
    Directory Specification.

I don't offer compile-time path choice like `configure --prefix=/usr'.
If you would like that, and the above `-b releaseXDG' is not enough,
file an issue on github. :-)

With `-b release' instead of `-b releaseXDG', Lix would be self-contained,
i.e., read and write only within its working directory.

The release binary should have reasonable runtime speed already. To optimize
even more for speed, use GDC or LDC instead of the reference compiler DMD.
It's also possible, but discouraged by the D community, to disable even
the array bounds checks; you'd have to edit the build type `releaseXDG'
in `dub.json' according to the dub package format.
