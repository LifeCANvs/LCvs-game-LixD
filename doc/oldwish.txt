C++ Lix: Old Feature Wishes
===========================

I have written and maintained C++ Lix from 2006 to 2015. Over these years,
I've met exciting people, and they presented ideas for new features.
Here is the list of features suggested for C++ Lix.

Make a scollbar instead of "next" button in file browsers.
D:  Scrollbar implemented.

With the "next" button, show only some elements on the final page, such that
the last element is always ID p*n with n items per page, and p integer.
D:  Scrollbar is superior.

Levels that have replays should be marked in the singleplayer browser.
Make these replays runnable from the singleplayer browser.
D:  Not implemeted, but good idea.

Maps should tile themselves for multiplayer. You build one cell in the editor
and specify how it tiles.
D:  Moderately interesting for a single map, but better if you generate maps
    for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 people all from one such template map.

Assignment shouldn't cancel pause. Or should it? Has both advantages
(flexibility) and disadvantages (extra keypress if you want to continue).
Possibly as an option.
D:  Up for debate.

Changing priority/z-coordinate on selection in the editor: If there are
multiple pieces selected, their relative z-order should be maintained when
changing terrain priority. Currently, they get messed up.
D:  Fixed.

Advanced trap definitions: For traps, a recolored lix animation should be
played. A sound effect should be specifiable in the object definition.
Lix animation could be a custom one or one of the existing ones, and allows
for proper coloring of player lixes, and maintaining the position
of a lix that gets into a trap.
D:  Too complicated to be worthwhile soon. Annoy me if you find this important.

Roper from Lemmings 2.
D:  An extra skill with an extra two-click user interface? Please no.
    The cuber adds terrain quickly.

Resolution: Higher resolution than the internal 640x480 inside the game,
even if it won't be used in the menu.
D:  Implemented. I allow arbitrary resolutions everywhere.

Nuke disabling: Each level could have the nuke for multiplayer disabled.
Players can still activate a nuke-like function then, but it merely takes
away control over their tribe and starts the overtime.
D:  Excellent idea. I want to make this standard in D Lix.

Statistics: After a game, you can view better statistics than now. The better
screen could show how many lixes every player got from whom.
D:  Good idea for when I implement the networking mode.

Networking pause: Keep the game running even if a player presses [ESC] during
a networking game.
D:  Requirement for the D networking mode.

Level info: In the networking lobby, the preview image should display
skills, name of map, number of lixes, etc.
D:  Good idea.

Highscore weight: User option to rank solution time over skills used.
D:  Won't implement. We want universally comparable scoring.

Extend highscores: Save more than only one best result per user.
Allow comparison of multiple users.
D:  If we do this at all, let's do it online.
