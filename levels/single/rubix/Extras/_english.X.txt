This map was a collaboration experiment
that I organized back in 2013

The map was broken into 6 small areas
completely divided by metal.  Each person 
was then given 1 section to add some terrain.

Rubix, Mobius, Proxima, Clam, Akseli, Aidan

Once everyone had contributed, each person then
used the map to create a puzzle.  
You could ONLY modify the metal borders, not the inside terrain.
You could place your own hatches and exits also.

The puzzles were extremely different and fun.

Some of these are VERY hard maps to solve!
