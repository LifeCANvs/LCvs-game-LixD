module gui.msgbox;

/* These boxes pose a question and give a few buttons to click.
 * How to use: Create a box, add some msgs and buttons, and register it
 * as a focus element. The box deactivates itself on any button click.
 *
 * To decide what to do after a button press, I had a choice about what
 * implementation to offer:
 *
 * a) Checking the return value of the box in the caller's calc()
 * b) Allowing callbacks to be registered on button creation
 * c) Both
 *
 * I chose b) only. Reason: a), and therefore c), lead to a flickering problem.
 * After the msgbox unfocuses itself, it is not drawn, but the calling
 * browser is not calced immediately. Therefore, a level to be deleted is
 * yet again drawn for a single frame.
 *
 * I could have edited the gui.root source to always calc the next focus/elders
 * when a focus (the msgbox in our case) unfocuses itself. The problem here
 * would be: The browser reads the hotkey input again. OK and "start replay"
 * are on the same hotkey by default. This would delete a level, select a
 * new one, and play that immediately.
